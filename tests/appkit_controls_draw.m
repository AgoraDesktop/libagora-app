 * **THE DEMONSTRATION FOR THE CONTROL LAYER, AND IT IS A DEMONSTRATION RATHER THAN A TEST.** The offscreen
 * `control_ink` test asserts the pixels; this puts the controls in a real window on Agora's window server so what the
 * slice draws can be LOOKED at — and it is what found the subview-placement defect in `NSView -displayRect:`, which
 * no offscreen draw of a single view could have shown.
 *
 * **AND IT SETS A MAIN MENU, WHICH THE FIRST VERSION DID NOT.** A window with controls and no `-setMainMenu:` leaves
 * the bar showing only the server's System menu — the application's own menus are put there BY the application, so a
 * demonstration that never sets one shows no application menus at all. It sets one now, and the two halves
 * demonstrate EACH OTHER: the View menu's "Show Grid" is a CHECKED item whose state is validated against the
 * checkbox below it, "Undo" is DISABLED by the same validator, and the push button TOGGLES the checkbox — so a click
 * on a control changes a menu item, and the menu reports what the control says.
